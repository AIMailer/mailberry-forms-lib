Mailberry Forms library to use together with https://mailberry.ai form builder 

Based on: https://webpack.js.org/guides/author-libraries/

Best way to use this is to include it in a script tag like so:

`<script src="https://unpkg.com/mailberry-forms@0.3.0/dist/mailberry-forms.js"></script>`

Mind changing the package version on the src url!

in order to add a form you have to add a div element which accepts the following options

`<div data-mailberry-form-id="..." data-mailberry-format="..." data-mailberry-popup-option="... >`

### data-mailberry-form-id
...

### data-mailberry-format
...

### data-mailberry-popup-option
...
