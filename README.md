Mailberry Forms library to use together with https://mailberry.ai form builder 

Based on: https://webpack.js.org/guides/author-libraries/

Best way to use this is to include it in a script tag like so:

`<script src="https://unpkg.com/mailberry-forms@0.0.1/dist/mailberry-forms.js"></script>`

Mind changing the package version on the src url!
